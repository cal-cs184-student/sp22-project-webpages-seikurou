        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we simulated and rendered cloth.
            We first constructed the structure of the cloth by modelling it as a grid of points connected by forces that
            act like springs.
            We then implemented the simulation by computing forces, integrating them over time, and applying them to
            update the positions of the points on the cloth.
            Next, we added both external and internal collision handling.
            Finally, we worked on various techniques to render the cloth with different textures and lighting effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our collaboration, we sat next to each other and pair programmed.
            We would both read through the spec, then one person would code while the other would check for mistakes.
            It went great.
            We learned that thoroughly reading the spec is quite helpful.
        </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
        <p>
            To implement this part, we first created a grid of masses. Then, we created the springs that connect between
            the masses one at a time, including structural, shearing, and bending constraints. To account for edge
            cases, we offset our starting iteration indices as needed.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>
            To implement our simulation, we first calculate the forces on all our point masses. This is a combination of
            external acceleration (gravity) and the forces from the springs. We iterate over the springs and increment
            the point masses' total force accordingly. Then, we compute the masses' new positions at the next timestep
            using Verlet
            integration, which only uses the current/previous positions and acceleration (computed from forces) to
            compute the next position. Finally, we constrain the point masses' positions such that the spring length is
            at most 10% longer than the rest length.
        </p>
        <div align="middle">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <p>
                    With a low ks or high density, the cloth is very loose and flexible. This is because there is higher
                    acceleration acting on the masses. With either adjustment, the masses are able to "pull more" on the
                    masses--the masses are heavier or the springs are looser. The final position hangs
                    rather low from the two points:
                </p>

        <p>
            With a high ks or low density, the cloth is more rigid. This is because there is lower acceleration on
            the masses. It seems the ratio of ks and density is all that matters. The final position hangs higher from
            the two points:

            With a high damping, the cloth falls very slowly towards its final position. With low damping, the cloth
            does not really reach a resting state but instead swings wildly like a pendulum:

        <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
        <p>
            To implement sphere collisions, we check if any points are inside the sphere. For these points, we move them
            back outside the sphere using its previous position and a friction factor. To implement plane collisions, we
            check if any points are not above the plane, moving them back above the plane using its previous position
            and a friction factor.

            With low ks, there are more folds on the cloth that rests on the sphere. Likewise, with higher ks, there are
            fewer folds on the cloth. With higher ks, this makes the springs less stretchy and the cloth overall more
            rigid, requiring more weight to bend the cloth. As a result, there are fewer folds.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
        <p>
            To implement self-collisions, we split the space into a 3D grid of box volumes. Then, we set up hash
            partitioning
            where masses in the same box hash to the same value. Then we use this value to lookup a list of all the
            masses
            in the box volume. Thus, for each mass, we only need to check for collisions with other masses by checking
            all the masses in its associated list. When there is a collision, we move the masses directly away from each
            other so that they are a minimum distance apart while keeping fixed masses fixed.

            With low ks or high density, the cloth is much more loose and flexible and more likely to fold over on
            itself multiple times. Even as it falls there are many folds that are visible. In contrast, high ks/low
            density makes the cloth more rigid, resulting in the cloth folding over itself less. The cloth also has more
            of the apperance of falling over like a rigid object might. It also has a tendency to roll out after falling
            down.
        </p>
        <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>

        <p>
            A shader program is used to determine how a scene is rendered by shading.
            Our shader program is a combination of a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
            The vertex shader takes as input the vertices, and performs transformations on the position and orientation.
            The output of this vertex shader is then fed into the input of the fragment shader.
            The fragments here represent samples in the image (ie pixels) while vertices represent samples (ie points)
            in the scene.
            The fragment shader uses the values generated by the vertex shader for each vertex to output a color.
        </p>


        <p>
            The Blinn-Phong shading model is a way to model how light reflects off objects in a scene.
            It proposes that the final rendering of an object is comprised of three components: ambient, diffuse, and
            specular.
            Ambient refers to ambient light, and acts as a constant color base.
            Diffuse gives color shading that doesn't depend on viewing direction.
            Specular depends on viewing direction with respect to lighting.

        <p>
            The bump and displacement mapping both use the underlying texture to give the appearance of a textured
            surface.
            But bump mapping leaves the sphere's shape intact, so that the surface looks textured (bumpy) but the
            overall shape is still about the same.
            Displacement mapping morphs the positions of the vertices as well, making more visible peaks and crests, and
            not only changes the surface texture, but also the overall figure and shape.
            This can be best observed at the edges of the sphere. The sphere in bump mapping maintains smooth circular edges
            while displacement mapping changes the edges to reflect the appearance of the texture.

            When we decrease the sphere mesh's courseness, the effects are much less pronounced, especially in
            displacement mapping. In other words, high coarseness does not affect bump mapping as much as it affects
            displacement mapping.
