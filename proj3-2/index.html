        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we implemented additoinal features into the path tracer, including modeling mirror and
            glass materials by modeling their BSDFs and depth of field by modeling a basic thin-lens that has a given
            diameter and focal distance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our collaboration, we sat next to each other and pair programmed.
            We would both read through the spec, then one person would code while the other would check for mistakes.
            It went great.
            We learned that thoroughly reading the spec is quite helpful.
        </p>


        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>

        <p>
            To implement reflection, we constructed the reflection vector based on the x, y, and z directions of the incoming vector, which is just (-x, -y, z).
            To implement mirror materials, we use our reflection implementation. The PDF here is 1, because the sampled direction is the same every time. We also divide out the Lambertian cosine term since everything is reflected back.
            To implement refraction, we follow the refraction equations derived from Snell's Law to determine how refracted rays behave given the index of refraction, transmittance, the direction of ray, and whether it is entering or exiting.
            To implement glass materials, we use both our reflection and refraction implementations, randomly reflecting some rays and refracting others using Schlick's approximation to determine these probabilities.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Depth of Field</h2>

        <p>
            In the pinhole camera model, all the light that hits the sensor passes through a single point that is
            infinitely small. This means everything in the scene is in focus. But in the thin-lens camera model, light
            that hits a given point on the image sensor could have come from any part of the lens, not just a single
            point. In addition, rays that pass through the lens may be refracted and change direction, instead of just
            passing directly through. This property can result in a depth of field effect, where only a part of the
            image is in focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our implementation of the thin-lens model, we still sample one pixel on the image sensor at a time.
            Instead of tracing rays directly into the scene through the pinhole point (0,0,0), we trace the ray through
            a randomly chosen point on the lens, determine the refraction, then trace the point on the lens into the
            scene as before. To find refraction, we first determine the point on the plane of focus corresponding to the
            point on the image plane by casting a ray from the point on the image plane through the origin onto the
            plane of focus (rays that go through the center of the lens do not refract). This point on the plane of
            focus is the direction into the scene that the point on the lens should be traced.

        <p>
            By adjusting the focal distance, we move the plane of focus and the depth of view such that only some parts
            of the scene are in focus, as described in the captions. For a given pixel on the image sensor, we can draw
            all the rays from the pixel that can refract
            through the lens to get a double cone. If all the rays hit the intersection point of these cones (on the
            plane of focus), then that pixel will be drawn perfectly in focus. Otherwise, the intersection of the cones
            and the scene will have some nontrivial area, meaning that the pixel is composed of multiple points in the
            scene, which creates a blurring effect.

        <p>
            By adjusting the aperture, we effectively are able to cast more rays into the scene, increasing exposure.
            In practice for this pathtracer, as we increase the aperture size, the blurring effect becomes more
            pronounced. To see why, we go back to the discussion in the previous paragraph and observe the double cones
            that are drawn by casting rays from a pixel on the image sensor onto all parts of the lens and refracted
            into the scene. By increasing
            the aperture size, we increase the size of the lens, creating a set of "fatter" cones. The effect is that
            the
            same offset from the plane of focus will intersect a larger area of the scene, creating more blur for a
            given pixel--the pixel is composed of a larger part of the scene. In more technical terms, we have increased
            the circle of confusion and decreased the depth of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that for lens radius of 0, everything is in focus because this is effectively a pinhole camera where
            the cones are infinitely thin.
