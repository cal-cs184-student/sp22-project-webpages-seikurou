    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we implemented Bezier curves/surfaces and a variety of mesh operations, including edge flips and
      splits. In the first section, we wrote code that evaluated Bezier surfaces in 3D at a given parameter. By
      evaluating enough parameters we can draw the curve/surface on the screen. In the second section, we wrote code
      that flipped and split edges in a triangle mesh without boundaries. Finally, we utilized these operations to
      implement Loop subdivision, which upsamples a mesh and interpolates between triangles with a tendency to smooth
      out surfaces. Additionally, we implemented area weighted vertex normals to allow for smooth shading of rendered
      meshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      We learned the importance of proper planning before implementation as well as the nuances of C++ iterators. By
      implementing the algorithms we learned, we have a more precise understanding of how they work.
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is used to evaluate points along a Bezier curve.
      Using the set of n ordered control points that define the curve, the algorithm performs linear interpolation
      (lerp) on each consecutive set of two points, generating n - 1 new points.
      Using the new points, the algorithm recursively performs lerps until a single point is left. This is the point on
      the Bezier curve.
      Each of these lerps is parametrized by a parameter t, where the first point is weighted by (1-t) and the second
      point is weighted by t.
      Drawing the entire curve requires evaluating the algorithm at all t: [0, 1].
    </p>
    <p>
      Our implementation uses C++ 2D vectors to store points.
      To perform one step of the algorithm to go from n to n - 1 points, we perform n - 1 iterations over the given
      points,
      lerp between points i and i + 1, and add the new point onto a list (c++ vector).
      This list is returned.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      Bezier surfaces are like Bezier curves, but the control points are indexed with a second dimension to create n*n
      control points.
      <!-- To generalize, evaluating either involves flattening dimensions one at a time until a single point is left.
        Flattening a single dimension/axis occurs by running de Casteljau's algorithm on each set of points that run along a particular axis.
        An axis may contain more than one set of points, so de Casteljau's algorithm may run more than once to flatten a single dimension.
        In the 2D case, each row is a set of points that run along the horizontal axis. -->
      To evaluate a Bezier curve, we flatten a 1D set of control points by running de Casteljau's algorithm once to
      yield a single point.
      To evaluate a Bezier surface, we effectively "flatten" one axis by running de Casteljau's algorithm n times on
      each row or on each column to get a 1D set of n new control points,
      then flatten this remaining axis (which is effectively just a Bezier curve) to get
      the point on the surface. Because we have two dimensions, we have two parameters u: [0, 1] and v: [0, 1], one for
      each axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our implementation, we have a 2D array of control points which contain n rows of n control points.
      To flatten the first axis, we run de Casteljau's algorithm n times with parameter u on the n rows, each containing
      n control points.
      This yields n new control points. We run de Casteljau's algorithm on these new control points with parameter v to
      yield the final point on the surface.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by traversing the half-edges to loop over all neighboring non-boundary
    faces of a vertex, then summing together the normal vectors at each of these faces.
    We weight the normal vectors by the areas of their triangular faces, which we compute with Heron's formula by using
    the side-lengths of the faces. This final summed vector is normalized to a unit vector.

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

    To implement edge flips, we first drew out a diagram for the edge-flip between two triangles.
    We labeled all the elements (edges, faces, half-edges, vertices) before flipping.
    Then we did the same for the diagram after flipping.
    In our code, we simply enumerated all the elements we needed to redirect pointers for, and reassigned their values.
    We found that when flipping edges, sometimes an edge would seem to disappear when flipped. And sometimes an edge
    flip results in unexpected shading on the involved triangles.
    The overall code changes were a bit verbose but much simpler than we expected.
    We didn't have an eventful debugging journey, though we were surprised by the syntax of just reassigning references
    returned from functions directly (e.g. h0->halfedge() = h1)

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    We implemented edge splits similarly to how we implemented edge flips.
    We drew a diagram of the before/after elements for an edge split.
    This was more complicated because we had to add new elements, but overall it was the same approach of simply listing
    out all the relavant elements and reassigning their attributes.
    One of our team members unfortunately has atrocious handwriting, and also mislabeled a half-edge on the hand-drawn
    diagram we were referencing. The team member who implemented (but did not draw) the diagram occasionally misread
    labels.
    These factors likely did not aid in our debugging efforts.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

    <p>
      We followed the recommended algorithm for Loop subdivision. First, we computed the new positions for existing
      vertices and stored them into its <code>newPosition</code> attribute. Their <code>isNew</code> attribute is set to
      false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we computed the new positions for future new vertices at the midpoint of existing edges, storing this
      in the edge's <code>isNew</code> attribute. While iterating over all edges, we also store the last edge we
      encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we split all existing edges while copying over their <code>newPosition</code> attribute to the
      new vertex. To do so, we iterate over all edges until we encounter the stored last edge from above. This is so we
      do not accidentally split new edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we flip edges using the <code>isNew</code> attribute of the edge and its two vertices. In our
      implementation, the edge's <code>isNew</code> attribute determines eligibility for flipping and does not
      correspond to newly created edge objects during edge splitting. This is why we used a stored last edge to prevent
      infinite looping when splitting edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we copy over all vertices' <code>newPositions</code>s into their actual position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debugging this part mainly consisted of reading the code again and commenting out loops to isolate infinite
      looping, then making as few assumptions as possible about how the iterators work.

    <p>
      Notice that edges and corners are very smoothed out. The algorithm does not distinguish between sharp edges or
      approximated smooth edges and tends towards the latter when interpolating. Thus it performs better on objects
      already meant to be smooth. We can mitigate this effect on a cube by adding many faces to each face of the cube to
      give more "intention" to the original geometry:
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="imgs/6.1.jpg" width="500px" />

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      To make the cube subdivide symmetrically, we can split each edge on each face. Initially, the cube mesh geometry
      was not symmetric, as a result of using minimal triangles to represent the cube. Not all vertices can have the
      same degree. Vertices with higher degree experience more smoothing because in the algorithm its neighbors would
      receive more weight. As a result, the eight original vertices are not repositioned symmetrically. By splitting
      each edge, each vertex has equal degree and the mesh becomes more symmetric, resulting in equally symmetric
      subdivisions and vertex repositioning.
